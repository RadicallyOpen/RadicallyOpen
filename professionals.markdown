### Training Pathways

There are 2 training pathways in RO-DBT and 4 levels of proficiency: Certificates of Attendance will be given to everyone who completes a training module, and attendees also have the opportunity of Certification. Certification requires the submission of homework assignments demonstrating an understanding of the material taught. Therapist can only progress to proficiency levels 3 and 4 if they have achieved Certification at levels 1 and 2.

#### Fast track {#fast}

Our fast track training is an intensive course, comprisong 3 x 5-day workshops (Parts I, II and III). These are sequential, must be taken in order. Practitioners will be able to progress to advanced level training if they have attained certification in all 3 workshops.


#### Modular {#modular}

Our modular course comprises a series of 1, 2 or 3-day workshops, grouped into three modules. These modules are sequential and need to be taken in order, but within each level the workshops can be attended in any order.
