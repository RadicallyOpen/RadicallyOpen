### Training Pathways

We offer 2 training pathways in RO-DBT, leading to four levels of proficiency: a series of week-long intensive workshops, and a modular programme of 1-day workshops.

Certificates of attendance are issued for all training modules. In addition, by submitting homework assignments to demonstrate their understanding of the material taught, intensive course attendees have the opportunity of to register for certification as an RO-DBT practioner.


#### Intensive {#intensive}

Our intensive training is a fast-track programme of 3 x 5-day workshops. The workshops are sequential, and must be taken in order. After completing the intensive training, practitioners may choose to progress to advanced level training and supervision.


#### Modular {#modular}

Our modular course comprises a series of 1, 2 or 3-day workshops, grouped into three modules. These modules are sequential and need to be taken in order, but within each level the workshops can be attended in any order.
