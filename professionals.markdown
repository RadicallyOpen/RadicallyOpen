---


We work with coaches, counsellors, nurses, occupational therapists, psychiatrists, psychologists, psychotherapists and social workers.   Where possible, we encourage a team-based approach to learning RO DBT. Although suitable for independent practitioners, all of our courses emphasise a multi-disciplinary approach.

RO DBT is a novel treatment specifically designed for [patients with overcontrol](/about/), and does not require prior training in standard DBT. A majority of RO DBT trainees are not standard-DBT trained.


### RO DBT training

We presently offer two routes into RO DBT.

Our [introduction to RO DBT](/training/introduction/) is a comprehensive introduction to RO DBT. It is suitable for all professionals working in the field of mental health and contributes 6 hours of Continuing Professional Development.

Our [intensive training](/training/intensive/) is a two-part fast-track programme, consisting of 2 x 5-day workshops.
