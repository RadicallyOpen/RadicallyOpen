### RODBT training

We presently offer two routes into RODBT.

Our [introduction to RODBT](/training/introduction.html) is a comprehensive introduction to RODBT. It is suitable for all professionals working in the field of mental health and contributes 6 hours of Continuing Professional Development.

Our [intensive training](/training/intensive.html) is a two-part fast-track programme, consisting of 2 x 5-day workshops.


- [See the current list of training courses and dates](/events/).


### What do clinicians think of RODBT?

RODBT is a new treatment, but we regularly hear very positive accounts from clinicians learning and applying these new ideas in their own practice. We've collected some of these reports below:

Mark Sanbrook FRANZCP, (Senior Staff Specialist Psychiatrist, Hornsby Mental Health Service Private Practice, Australia) [reflects on radical openness](/assets/Mindcafe_issue 02_final.pdf) in a recent Mindcafe article [^subs]:

> It also made me think about us as clinicians... we inhibit our feelings to remain the calmest person in the room, when we may feel anything but. It seems crucial that we practice some radical openness with someone in our life to promote our own emotional health.

Clarissa ([@GeekyOT](https://twitter.com/GeekyOT)) writes about attending an RODBT intensive and [looking to apply radical openness in the practice as an Occupational Therapist](http://shamelessotgeek.wordpress.com/2014/07/06/discovering-radically-open-dialectical-behaviour-therapy-ro-dbt/):

> Iâ€™m still in the early stages of my RODBT training, [but] really excited to learn more about it. I can see lots of applications and think it will be very valuable when interwoven with my occupational therapy practice.



Carl Dunn Jr, Mental Health Educator, Houston Texas, [recently tweeted](https://twitter.com/CarlDunnJr/status/485115757203054593):

> I think Radically Open - DBT treats a significant, often overlooked, group of people-those who "quietly" control emotions.
