Radically Open Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (RO-DBT) is a major adaptation of standard DBT for patients who suffer from emotional over-control. RO-DBT was developed at the University of Southampton for patients with chronic depression or anorexia nervosa, and [research results](http://www.radical-openness.com/research.html) suggest that it is effective in these hard-to-treat groups.

We are now offering Intensive training courses in RO-DBT, in the UK, Europe and USA. Our next date is in Southampton, running from the 15th to the 19th of September, 2014.
