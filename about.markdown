> Radically Open Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (RO DBT) is a new treatment for patients who suffer from emotional over-control.

RO DBT has been developed over the past 20 years for patients with chronic depression or anorexia nervosa. [Research results](http://www.southampton.ac.uk/psychology/research/groups/emotion_and_personality_bio_behavioural_laboratory.page#projects) suggest that it is effective in these, and other, hard-to-treat groups.


#### Emotional over control {#overcontrol}

'Self-control' is thought desirable, and uncontrolled behaviour is often censured. However too-much self-control is a problem for many patients. Excessive self-control is associated with social isolation, poor interpersonal relations, and contributes to difficult-to-treat conditions including anorexia nervosa and chronic depression (see Lynch & Cheavens, 2008; Riso et al., 2003; Zucker et al., 2007).


#### A new treatment

RO DBT draws on principles and strategies from third-wave cognitive behavioural therapies, including dialectical behaviour therapy. It differs from previous treatments because it recognises that a fundamentally different approach is needed for patients who suffer from too much control.

> Some patients lack emotional control and need interventions designed to enhance constraint or inhibitory control; others require interventions designed to relax rigid or inflexible inhibitory control.

Treatment strategies in RO DBT derive from the theory that three, interrelated traits are required for emotional well-being:

1. Receptivity and *openness* to feedback, even when this is challenging.
2. *Flexibility* in our responses to changing environmental demands, and
3. Recognition that emotions evolved to communicate, and that *expressing emotion* is an important social signal to others which helps us form close interpersonal bonds.



#### A growing evidence base

RO DBT is now practised in the UK, Europe, and North America, and is increasingly recognised as effective for patients who exhibit emotional over-control.

- The [RO DBT and radical-openness research website](http://www.southampton.ac.uk/psychology/research/groups/emotion_and_personality_bio_behavioural_laboratory.page) has more information on the latest research and development of the treatment, and the growing evidence base for RO DBT in patients with chronic depression and anorexia nervosa.
