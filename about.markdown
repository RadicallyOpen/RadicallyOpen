> Radically Open Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (RO DBT) is a new treatment for patients who suffer from emotional over-control.

RO DBT has been developed over the past 20 years for patients with chronic depression or anorexia nervosa. [Research results](http://www.southampton.ac.uk/psychology/research/projects/radically_open_dialectical_behaviour_therapy.page) suggest that it is effective in these, and other, hard-to-treat groups.

#### Emotional over control {#overcontrol}

'Self-control' is thought desirable, and uncontrolled behaviour is often censured. However too-much self-control is a problem for many patients. Excessive self-control is associated with social isolation, poor interpersonal relations, and contributes to difficult-to-treat conditions including anorexia nervosa and chronic depression (see Lynch & Cheavens, 2008; Riso et al., 2003; Zucker et al., 2007).


#### A new treatment

RO DBT offers a fundamentally different way to treat patients with overcontrol.
The treatment starts by observing three core components of emotional well-being:

1. *Openness* to feedback, even when this is challenging.
2. *Flexibility* in our responses to changing environmental demands, and
3. *Communication* of our emotions, with a recognition that expressing emotion is crucial when forming close interpersonal bonds.

> Some patients lack emotional control and need interventions designed to enhance constraint or inhibitory control; others require interventions designed to relax rigid or inflexible inhibitory control.

Treatment strategies aim to build:

- Acknowledgment and awareness of feedback that is unexpected or challenging.
- Self enquiry into habitual responses to challenging feedback and our urges to regulate emotional responses to feedback (for example to defend, capitualte, avoid, or accept).
- Flexible responding to the demands of the moment, with great emphasis on the importance of emotional expression to facilitate positive interpersonal relationships.



#### A growing evidence base

RO DBT is now practised in the UK, Europe, and North America, and is increasingly recognised as effective for patients who exhibit emotional over-control.

- The [RO DBT and radical-openness research website](http://www.southampton.ac.uk/psychology/research/projects/radically_open_dialectical_behaviour_therapy.page) has more information on the latest research and development of the treatment, and the growing evidence base for RO DBT in patients with chronic depression and anorexia nervosa.
