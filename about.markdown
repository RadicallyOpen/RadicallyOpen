> Radically Open Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (RO-DBT) is a major adaptation of standard DBT for patients who suffer from emotional over-control.

RO-DBT has been developed over the past 20 years, in labs in the US and UK, for patients with chronic depression or anorexia nervosa. [Research results](http://www.southampton.ac.uk/psychology/research/groups/emotion_and_personality_bio_behavioural_laboratory.page#projects) suggest that it is effective in these, and other, hard-to-treat groups.


#### Emotional over control {#overcontrol}

Although 'self-control' is thought desirable---and uncontrolled behaviour is often censured---self-control is an underlying factor in many treatment-resistant conditions. Excessive self-control is associated with social isolation, poor interpersonal functioning, and can result in severe and difficult-to-treat mental health problems, such as anorexia nervosa, chronic depression, and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (e.g., Lynch & Cheavens, 2008; Riso et al., 2003; Zucker et al., 2007).


#### A significant adaptation of standard DBT

Standard DBT was developed for patients with Borderline Personality Disorder (Linehan, 1993) and is highly effective for these under-controlled patients. Nonetheless, DBT is a treatment for patients who lack inhibitory control; as a consequence, RO-DBT makes substantial adaptations to meet the needs of patients who exhibit emotional over-control.


> Some patients lack emotional control and need interventions designed to enhance constraint or inhibitory control; others require interventions designed to relax rigid or inflexible inhibitory control.

Treatment strategies in RO-DBT derive from the theory that three, interrelated traits are required for emotional well-being:

1. Receptivity and *openness* to feedback, even when this is challenging.
2. *Flexibility* in our responses to changing environmental demands, and
3. Recognition that emotions evolved to communicate, and that *expressing emotion* is an important social signal to others which helps us form close interpersonal bonds.



#### A growing evidence base

RO-DBT is now practised in the UK, Europe, and North America, and is increasingly recognised as effective for patients who exhibit emotional over-control.

- The [RO-DBT research website](http://www.southampton.ac.uk/psychology/research/groups/emotion_and_personality_bio_behavioural_laboratory.page) has more information on the latest research and development of the treatment, and the growing evidence base for RO-DBT in patients with chronic depression and anorexia nervosa.
