> Radically Open Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (RO-DBT) is a major adaptation of standard DBT for patients who suffer from emotional over-control.

RO-DBT was developed at the University of Southampton for patients with chronic depression or anorexia nervosa, and [research results](http://www.radical-openness.com/research.html) suggest that it is effective in these hard-to-treat groups.

RO-DBT targets emotional over-control, the mechanism underlying many *treatment-resistant conditions*. Although lack of self-control is typically considered undesirable, too much self-control can be equally problematic. Excessive self-control is associated with social isolation, poor interpersonal functioning, and severe and difficult-to-treat mental health problems, such as *anorexia nervosa*, *chronic depression*, and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (e.g., Lynch & Cheavens, 2008; Riso et al., 2003; Zucker et al., 2007).

Although Radically Open DBT (RO-DBT) builds upon many of the core principles of DBT for borderline personality disorder (Linehan, 1993) the history of DBT as a treatment for patients who lack inhibitory control demanded significant adaptations for patients with emotional over-control.  RO-DBT treatment strategies  are derived from three overlapping traits posited to be associated with emotional well-being: 1) receptivity or *openness* to disconfirming feedback; 2) *flexible-responding* to changing environmental demands, and 3) recognition that emotions evolved to *communicate* and the importance of social signaling to the formation of close interpersonal bonds.

> In short, whereas under-controlled problems require interventions designed to enhance constraint or inhibitory control, over-controlled problems require interventions designed to relax rigid inhibitory control, and to increase emotional expressiveness, receptivity, and flexibility.
