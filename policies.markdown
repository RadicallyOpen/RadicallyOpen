## Booking and cancellation policy

We offer early bird discounts for participants booking 30 days or more before the start of a course.

Registration fees will be refunded to participants who contact us in writing or via email to info@radicallyopen.net postmarked no less than 15 days before the training. No refunds will be made thereafter. A colleague may be substituted for no extra charge if we are notified at least two business days before the training.

All payments must be recieved at least 10 working days before the course start date.



## Complaints

We know we are not perfect. But we aim to be. That is why we have a complaints procedure. Sometimes we can put things right; sometimes we can only explain ourselves and apologise. But we do want to learn from our mistakes. What you tell us helps to improve our service to you.

> We will treat your complaint confidentially, seriously and quickly.

Let us know if you are unhappy and give us a chance to put things right. If you are not satisfied, the next step is to make a formal complaint by:

- Writing or emailing us explaining what went wrong.
- Writing to the British Pyschological Association ([see this page for details](http://www.bps.org.uk/what-we-do/bps/submitting-complaint-against-society-member/submitting-complaint-against-society-memb)).



## Privacy and 'cookies'

What information do we collect? How do we use it?

- When you register online for workshops or other training events, we need to know your name, e-mail address, mailing address, and (sometimes) your credit card billing address, credit card number, and expiration date. This allows us to process your registration and notify you that your registration was successfully completed. If you are not comfortable transmitting any of this information via the Internet, please feel to contact to provide the information over the telephone.

- We monitor customer traffic patterns and site usage to help us develop the design and layout of Site. [See our statement on cookies for more details](/cookies.html)

- We may also use the information we collect to occasionally notify you about important functionality changes to the Site or to send you other information we think you'll find helpful. However, we will only do this if you have opted-in to receiving those mailings. Also, if at any time you decide you no longer wish to receive them, you can always opt-out by e-mailing us at unsubscribe@radicallyopen.net

- Your details may also be disclosed to third parties (e.g. venues, accomodation) to facilitate running of the courses. We will not disclose your details to third parties for marketing purposes.

By using this site, you consent to the collection and use of this information by Radically Open as we describe here. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.
