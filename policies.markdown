# Our policies


## Complaints

We know we are not perfect. But we aim to be. That is why we have a complaints procedure. Sometimes we can put things right; sometimes we can only explain ourselves and apologise. But we do want to learn from our mistakes. What you tell us helps to improve our service to you.

> We will treat your complaint confidentially, seriously and quickly.

Let us know if you are unhappy and give us a chance to put things right. If you are not satisfied, the next step is to make a formal complaint by:

- Writing or emailing us explaining what went wrong.
- Writing to the British Pyschological Association ([see this page for details](http://www.bps.org.uk/what-we-do/bps/submitting-complaint-against-society-member/submitting-complaint-against-society-memb)).
