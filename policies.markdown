## Booking and cancellation policy

We offer early bird discounts for participants booking 45 days or more before the start of a course.

Registration fees (minus administration costs of Â£100 + additional credit card charges if applicable) will be refunded to participants who contact us in writing or via email to [Erica Smith](mailto:erica@radicallyopen.net) postmarked no less than 1 month before part 1 of the training begins. No refunds will be made thereafter. A colleague may be substituted on the part 1 for no extra charge if we are notified at least two business days before the training. If for any reason a person has attended the part 1 but is unable to attend the part 2, we will offer substitute dates and locations, but no refunds will be made.

All payments must be received at least 10 working days before the course start date.



## Complaints

We know we are not perfect. But we aim to be. That is why we have a complaints procedure. Sometimes we can put things right; sometimes we can only explain ourselves and apologise. But we do want to learn from our mistakes. What you tell us helps to improve our service to you.

> We will treat your complaint confidentially, seriously and quickly.

Let us know if you are unhappy and give us a chance to put things right. If you are not satisfied, the next step is to make a formal complaint by writing or emailing us explaining what went wrong.




## Privacy and 'cookies'

What information do we collect? How do we use it?

- When you register online for workshops or other training events, we need to know your name, e-mail address, mailing address, and (sometimes) your credit card billing address, credit card number, and expiration date. This allows us to process your registration and notify you that your registration was successfully completed. If you are not comfortable transmitting any of this information via the Internet, please feel to contact to provide the information over the telephone.

- We monitor customer traffic patterns and site usage to help us develop the design and layout of Site. [See our statement on cookies for more details](/cookies.html)

- We may also use the information we collect to occasionally notify you about important functionality changes to the Site or to send you other information we think you'll find helpful. However, we will only do this if you have opted-in to receiving those mailings. Also, if at any time you decide you no longer wish to receive them, you can always opt-out by e-mailing us at [unsubscribe@radicallyopen.net](unsubscribe@radicallyopen.net)
