### Co-hosted training

We regularly run training in partnership with particular organisations, for example at specialist eating disorders services or inpatient units where a whole team wishes to train together. Forthcoming partners for co-hosted training include:

- [The Young Adult & Family Center, at the Langley Porter Psychiatric Institute](2015-05-san-francisco.html), University of California, San Francisco.
- [The Haldon Eating Disorders Service](2015-03-exeter-haldon-intensive.html), Wonford House Hospital, Exeter
- [South East Eating Disorders Scotland](2015-02-edinburgh-intensive.html) (SEEDS)
- [The Hertfordshire Community Eating Disorders Service](2015-04-hatfield-introduction.html), part of the Hertfordshire Partnership NHS University Foundation Trust.
- [The Derbyshire NHS Eating Disorders Service](2016-09-derbyshire-intensive.html), part of the Derbyshire NHS Foundation Trust

If you are interested in co-hosting a training course, please [get in touch](/contact/).


### Forthcoming workshops and training events

#### Please note: our Intensive Trainings consist of 2 x 5 days, with 6-9 months in between the two training weeks. If part 1 has already taken place it will no longer be possible to book onto that course.

#### Please note:
Attending an RO Intensive does not qualify or entitle you to teach RO yourself, and the teaching materials you receive from us are intended for your own learning and to help you treat your patients. You are of course free to copy the skills worksheets and handouts to share with your patients. 

If you would like to become a trainer or supervisor please get in touch with us. Our trainers and supervisors attend additional Intensives and regular Senior Clinician Meetings so they receive ongoing training and micro-supervision from Tom to ensure the highest quality of teaching.  

We recommend only using RO endorsed trainers and supervisors. A list of these can be found in the Supervision section on our e-learning website (accessible to paying delegates).
