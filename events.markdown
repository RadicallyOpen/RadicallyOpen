### Forthcoming workshops and training events

#### Please note: 
Our Intensive Trainings consist of 2 x 5 days, with 6-9 months in between the two training weeks. If part 1 has already taken place it will no longer be possible to book onto that course. 

#### Early bird rates
We offer an early bird rate up to 45 days before the event. The payment should be made before this date expires and/or within one month after receipt of our invoice.

#### Please note:

Attending the RO Intensive Training does not qualify you to train other clinicians in RO. Becoming an RO Trainer or Supervisor takes time and dedication. We do not believe that attending only one Intensive enables or qualifies you to train others without receiving supervision on this from our team. Our trainers and supervisors attend regular Senior Clinician Meetings and receive on-going micro-supervision to ensure the highest quality of teaching. 

We have a ‘Train the Trainer’ program at Radically Open Ltd and would be happy to talk to you about this if this is something you are interested in. 

The slides and training materials you receive from us are intended for your own learning and to help you treat your patients. They are not to be shared with others. The exception is with your clients: you are free to make copies of the handouts and worksheets to facilitate skills training with clients.
