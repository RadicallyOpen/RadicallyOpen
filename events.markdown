### Co-hosted training

We regularly run training in partnership with particular organisations, for example at specialist eating disorders services or inpatient units where a whole team wishes to train together. Forthcoming partners for co-hosted training include:

- [The Young Adult & Family Center, at the Langley Porter Psychiatric Institute](2015-05-san-francisco.html), University of California, San Francisco.
- [The Haldon Eating Disorders Service](2015-03-exeter-haldon-intensive.html), Wonford House Hospital, Exeter
- [South East Eating Disorders Scotland](2015-02-edinburgh-intensive.html) (SEEDS)
- [The Hertfordshire Community Eating Disorders Service](2015-04-hatfield-introduction.html), part of the Hertfordshire Partnership NHS University Foundation Trust.

If you are interested in co-hosting a training course in the UK or Europe, please also [get in touch](/contact/).
