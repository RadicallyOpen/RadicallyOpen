---

We offer online support for RO DBT delegates who attend Intensive Training courses. After we have received payment for attending the course, you will be sent an invitation
to the website. We currently use coursesites for this. 

To access the course, go to https://www.coursesites.com/s/_RO-2014. Then click ‘Login as an enrolled student’. This should take you straight to the page.
Please note: you should have registered first.
