---

We offer online support for RO DBT delegates who attend Intensive Training courses. After we have received payment for attending the course, you will be sent an invitation email to register on our elearning website. Access is free from the moment we have received payment up until 3 months after the end of part 2. 

After this time period, it is possible to purchase additional 3 months access to 'RO-DBT Online Extra' (Â£40 per 3 months). RO-DBT Online Extra includes RO-DBT Online but offers additional resources such as role-plays, knowledge quizzes, links to YouTube video's and anything else we think you might find useful when practicing RO. 

If you experience any problems with this, please contact [Roelie Hempel](mailto:roelie@radicallyopen.net)
