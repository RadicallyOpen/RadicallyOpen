---

We offer online support for RO DBT delegates who attend Intensive Training courses. After we have received payment for attending the course, you will be sent an invitation to the website. 

To access the course, go to [Radical Openness Online](https://www.coursesites.com/s/_RO-2014). Then click ‘Login as an enrolled student’. This should take you straight to the page.
Please note: you should have registered first.

If you experience any problems with this, please contact [Roelie Hempel](mailto:{{site.emails.technical}})
