meta_description: Information on how to access the online support website for RO DBT

---

We offer online support for RO DBT delegates who attend Intensive Training courses. Three months before the start of part 1 and after we have received payment, you will be sent an invitation email to register on our e-learning website. Access is free from the moment we have received payment up until 3 months after the end of part 2. 

After this time period, it is possible to purchase additional 3 or 12 months access to 'RO-DBT Online Extra' (£40 for 3 months, £120 for 12 months). RO-DBT Online Extra includes RO-DBT Online but offers additional resources such as role-plays, knowledge quizzes, links to YouTube video's and anything else we think you might find useful when practicing RO.
