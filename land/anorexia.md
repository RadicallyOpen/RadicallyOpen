[Radically Open Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (RODBT)](/about/) is a major adaptation of standard DBT for patients who suffer from emotional over-control.

RODBT has been developed over the past 20 years, in labs in the US and UK, for patients with disorders of emotional over-control, and the treatment was informed by our clinical partners at the [Haldon Eating Disorders Unit](http://www.devonpartnership.nhs.uk/The-Haldon.474.0.html) in Exeter.

Our approach to treating anorexia is novel. In the video below we show the effect of RODBT on patients and staff at the Haldon Unit:

[Research results](http://www.southampton.ac.uk/psychology/research/groups/emotion_and_personality_bio_behavioural_laboratory.page) suggest that RODBT  is effective in patients with anorexia, and leads to sustained gains in weight.
