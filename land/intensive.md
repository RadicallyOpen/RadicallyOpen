[Radically Open Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (RO DBT)](/about/) is a new treatment for patients who suffer from emotional over-control. RO DBT has been developed over the past 20 years, in labs in the US and UK, for patients with chronic depression and anorexia nervosa. [Research results](http://www.southampton.ac.uk/psychology/research/groups/emotion_and_personality_bio_behavioural_laboratory.page) suggest that it is effective in these hard-to-treat groups.

We are now offering intensive training in Radically Open DBT, in the UK, Europe and USA. The course is designed for practising clinical psychologists, psychotherapists, mental health nurses and other health professionals.

Our courses are engaging and hands on â€” we leave you with the skills and confidence to use RO DBT in your practice, and explain the treatment to your wider team.

Our next date is in [Southampton, running from the 15th to the 19th of September, 2014](/events/2014-september-intensive.html).
