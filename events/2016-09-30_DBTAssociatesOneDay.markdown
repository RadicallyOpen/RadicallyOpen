### Presenters: Anne Gresham & Chris Kvidera
DBT Associates offer an introductory training in RO-DBT on September 30th, 2016. Cost: $200. Time:  8:00 AM registration.  Workshop:  8:30 to 4:30.

### Who is the Treatment For?
The treatment is designed for Patients who have a diagnosis of Anorexia Nervosa, Chronic Depression, Treatment-Resistant Anxiety Disorders, Avoidant, Paranoid and Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorders and Autistic Spectrum Disorders.

### Rationale of the treatment:
Too much self-control can be problematic. Overcontrol (OC) has been linked to social isolation, poor interpersonal functioning, hyper-perfectionism, rigidity, risk aversion, lack of emotional expression, and the development of severe and difficult-to-treat mental health problems, such as chronic depression, anorexia nervosa, and obsessive compulsive personality disorder.
