Radically Open DBT offers hope for millions of chronically depressed patients, and patients with anorexia nervosa. At present our efforts are focussed on training professions to deliver this new treatment effectively, and to evaluate the effectiveness of RO-DBT in real world clinical settings, including within the UK's NHS.

To find out more about our current trial of RO-DBT for chronic depression visit the [REFRAMED trial website](http://www.reframed.org.uk).
