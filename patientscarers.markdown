Radically Open DBT offers hope for millions of chronically depressed patients, and patients with anorexia nervosa.

At present our efforts are focussed on training professionals to deliver this new treatment effectively, and to evaluate the effectiveness of RO-DBT in real world clinical settings. This includes studies which are recruiting patients within the UK's NHS.
