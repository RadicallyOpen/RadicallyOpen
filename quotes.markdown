RO DBT is a new treatment, but we regularly hear very positive accounts from clinicians learning and applying these new ideas in their own practice, and from patients who have experienced RO DBT treatment.


### What do patients say?

These quotes have been collected (with permission) from patients undergoing RO DBT for refractory depression:

<quote>Having been through several different therapies (CBT, standard DBT, counselling) this was by far the one that made a lot more sense :)</quote>

<center>~</center>


<quote>It's hard-going but a worthwhile commitment. I've had many years of psychiatrists watching brief  and twiddling with medication which has either been unhelpful, disastrous, or pointless from my perspective. This has been in depth purposeful help to understand myself much better and equip me with skills to challenge myself and thinking.”</quote>

<center>~</center>

<quote>RO DBT has changed my life dramatically. I am no longer depressed and have the ability of choice in my life (flexible mind). Before RO DBT I was very fixed and was in a deep depression, unable to make the changes I so desperately needed.</quote>

<center>~</center>

<quote>Just thank you… My challenge is to remain safe and well and I feel much more skilled to achieve this</quote>





### What do clinicians think of RO DBT?

[Mark Sanbrook](http://www.aushealthpages.com.au/psychiatry-related/psychiatry/sanbrook-mark) FRANZCP, (Senior Staff Specialist Psychiatrist, Hornsby Mental Health Service Private Practice, Australia) [reflects on radical openness](/assets/Mindcafe_issue 02_final.pdf) in a recent Mindcafe article [^subs]:

<quote>It also made me think about us as clinicians... we inhibit our feelings to remain the calmest person in the room, when we may feel anything but. It seems crucial that we practice some radical openness with someone in our life to promote our own emotional health.</quote>

[Sophie Rushbrook](http://uk.linkedin.com/pub/sophie-rushbrook/18/82/516), was one of the first UK therapists to start treating people using RO DBT:

<quote>I have been delivering DBT for ten years. Delivering RO DBT felt very different... I think we owe it to this client group to deliver a therapy that is potentially life-changing. There are some people who have come through this and although they still experience low mood at times, would say that they are no longer depressed. They feel as if they have the tools they need to manage better socially, to make different choices for themselves.</quote>



Clarissa ([@GeekyOT](https://twitter.com/GeekyOT)) writes about attending an [RO DBT intensive](/training/intensive/) and [looking to apply radical openness in the practice as an Occupational Therapist](http://shamelessotgeek.wordpress.com/2014/07/06/discovering-radically-open-dialectical-behaviour-therapy-ro-dbt/):

<quote>I’m still in the early stages of my RO DBT training, [but] really excited to learn more about it. I can see lots of applications and think it will be very valuable when interwoven with my occupational therapy practice.</quote>



Carl Dunn Jr ([@CarlDunnJr](https://twitter.com/CarlDunnJr)), Mental Health Educator, Houston Texas, [recently tweeted](https://twitter.com/CarlDunnJr/status/485115757203054593):

<quote>I think Radically Open - DBT treats a significant, often overlooked, group of people-those who "quietly" control emotions.</quote>



[Amy Gaglia](http://uk.linkedin.com/pub/amy-gaglia/61/513/835), NHS Therapist and DBT specialist at East London Foundation Trust:

<quote>I have found it to be very user-friendly. The patients themselves have said that they have found it very impactful... For me, I have found that it’s been very helpful to me to provide the therapy but also for my own personal life. RO DBT focuses in on social functioning and getting better relationships. Very few other therapeutic techniques teach patients actual skills — how to use their own body to help to them interact differently with and influence their environment. People pick the skills up fairly quickly.</quote>


[OpalFoodandBody](http://www.opalfoodandbody.com/) have been doing self-enquiry work within their team:

<quote>I can't tell you how powerful the self-inquiry work has been for our staff.  It has brought our staff closer and more aware of each other's growth edges.  It has allowed us to know how to better support one another's tender spots as we treat our clients.  Of course, this can't help but trickle down to our clients.</quote>

## What do clinicians think of our training sessions?


Feedback on our our RO DBT intensives is typically extremely positive. Overall ratings for our most recent one day institute at ABCT were as follows:

- Excellent: 93% (n=38) 
- Good: 7% (n=3) 
- Adequate: 0% (n=0) 
- Inadequate: 0 (n=0)

Some feedback from the delegates:

<quote>
Videos were excellent to demonstrate the approach with clients. Background explanations of theory and therapy were perfect given the constraints of  a single day workshop. I can’t wait to learn more though reading and more training
</quote>

Wonderful taste of RO – can’t wait to get more!
