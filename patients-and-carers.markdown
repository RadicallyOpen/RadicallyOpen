Radically Open DBT offers hope for millions of chronically depressed patients, and patients with anorexia nervosa.

At the moment we are focussed on training professionals to deliver this new treatment to patients, and to evaluate the effectiveness of RODBT in real-world clinical settings. We are expanding our schedule of training courses, and running randomised controlled trials of RODBT, recruiting patients within the UK's NHS.

- Find out more about our current trial of RODBT for chronic depression visit the [REFRAMED trial website](http://www.reframed.org.uk).
