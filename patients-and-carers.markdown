Radically Open DBT offers hope for millions of chronically depressed patients, and patients with anorexia nervosa.

> For a list of RO-DBT practitioners, please see the [RO-DBT therapist directory](http://www.radicallyopen.net/therapist-directory/index.html). If there's no practitiooner listed for your area, please [contact us](/contact/); we may be able to put you in touch with someone.

At the moment we are focussed on training professionals to deliver this new treatment to patients, and to evaluate the effectiveness of RO DBT in real-world clinical settings. We are expanding our schedule of training courses, and running randomised controlled trials of RO DBT, recruiting patients within the UK's NHS.
