The following is an *indicative* schedule for fast track training events. The exact running order may be subject to amendment and change, but this timetable gives a good feel for the scope and depth of the material covered in the 10 days --- this really is an intensive course!

Typically, the training will open for registration on the Monday morning at 8.30am with training starting at 9.30am and ending at 5.00pm. Training for the rest of the week will be from 9am – 5pm, with the exception of Friday, when we anticipate training will end at approximately 4.30pm. We will break for lunch for an hour each day.
