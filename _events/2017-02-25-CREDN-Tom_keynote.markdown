#### February 25th, 2017, Portland, OR 

## Keynote Professor Lynch: "Looking At Temperament: Evidence Based Treatments for Disorders of Over and Under Control"
### 20th Annual Columbia River Eating Disorder Network Conference
CREDN is pleased to welcome 2017 Keynote Speaker, Thomas Lynch, PhD!

Dr. Lynch is the founder and developer of Radically Open Dialectical Behavior Therapy (RO-DBT).
RO-DBT is an evidence based, transdiagnostic treatment for patients who suffer from emotional and behavioral over-control. RO-DBT has been researched over the past 20 years for patients with chronic depression or anorexia nervosa. Research results suggest that it is effective in these, and other, more complex groups that can be difficult to treat, such as Autism Spectrum Disorders and Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder.
