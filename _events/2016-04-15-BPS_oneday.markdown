#### Presenter: Thomas. R. Lynch, Ph.D., Professor of Clinical Psychology
The faculty of eating disorders would like to offer an introductory training in RO-DBT. This is currently being used in the treatment of people with Anorexia Nervosa. Radically Open Dialectical Behaviour Therapy is a new treatment that targets over-controlled behaviour. It has been used to treat some of the rigid responses and emotional inhibition thought to underlie many treatment-resistant conditions.

### Who is the Treatment For?
The treatment is designed for Patients who have a diagnosis of Anorexia Nervosa Chronic Depression Treatment-Resistant Anxiety Disorders, Avoidant, Paranoid and Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorders and Autistic Spectrum Disorders.

### Rationale of the treatment:
Too much self-control can be problematic. Overcontrol (OC) has been linked to social isolation, poor interpersonal functioning, hyper-perfectionism, rigidity, risk aversion, lack of emotional expression, and the development of severe and difficult-to-treat mental health problems, such as chronic depression, anorexia nervosa, and obsessive compulsive personality disorder.
