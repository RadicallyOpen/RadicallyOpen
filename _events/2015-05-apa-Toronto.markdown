#### Overview

This 6-hour workshop will explain that Radically Open Dialectical Behavior Therapy (RO-DBT) is a new transdiagnostic treatment targeting a spectrum of disorders characterized by emotional OC — such as refractory depression, anorexia nervosa and obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder. Efficacy is supported by two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) targeting refractory depression, one nonrandomized trial targeting treatment-resistant overcontrolled adults, two open-trials targeting adult anorexia nervosa, and an ongoing multicenter RCT (www.reframed.org.uk). RO-DBT does not believe
one size fits all. Reflecting NIMH RDoC initiatives, RO-DBT posits that core genotypic/phenotypic differences between groups of disorders necessitate oftentimes vastly different treatment approaches. A
novel mechanism linking the communicative functions of emotional expression to the formation of close social bonds and new skills activating neural
substrates associated with social safety and cooperative social signaling targeting emotional loneliness will be introduced

Educational Objectives: 
1) Be introduced to a new biosocial theory for overcontrol (OC) and new RO-DBT treatment strategies designed to enhance willingness for self-inquiry and flexible responding; 
2) Be introduced to new approaches for engaging and maintaining OC clients in therapy, manage therapeutic alliance-ruptures, and develop individualized treatment targets for OC; and 
3) Learn skills to activate specific neural substrates by directly activating its antagonistic autonomic nervous system — in particular the ventral vagal complex linked to social safety
