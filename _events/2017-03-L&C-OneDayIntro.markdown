### Presented by Kirsten McAteer, LPC, LLC
Radically Open Dialectical Behavior Therapy (RO-DBT) is a treatment for patients who suffer from emotional and behavioral over-control. Some clients lack emotional control and need interventions designed to enhance emotional and behavioral control; others, for whom RO-DBT is designed, require interventions designed to relax rigid or inflexible control. RO-DBT has been researched over the past 20 years for patients with chronic depression or anorexia nervosa. Research results suggest that it is effective in these, and other, hard-to-treat groups such as Autism Spectrum Disorders and Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder.

### Course objectives:
1.	Explain a new biosocial theory for OC 
2.	Describe a novel treatment mechanism positing open expression = trust = social connectedness 
3.	Describe new RO-DBT treatment strategies designed to enhance willingness for self-inquiry and flexible responding.
4.	Describe the four core deficits of Overcontrol
5.	Describe the RO-DBT treatment structure
6.	Describe the RO-DBT treatment hierarchy
7.	Explain the most common indirect social signalling styles in OC
