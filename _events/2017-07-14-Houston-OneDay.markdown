#### July 14th, 2017, Houston TX 

Join Hope Arnold, LCSW and Karyn Hall, PhD as they introduce the theoretical foundations and new skills underlying Radically Open-Dialectical Behavior Therapy (RO-DBT), developed by Dr. Tom Lynch. Excessive self-control has been linked to social isolation, aloof interpersonal functioning, maladaptive perfectionism, constricted emotional expressions, and difficult-to-treat mental health problems.
