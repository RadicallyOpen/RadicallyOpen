### An Introduction to RO-DBT: the foundations and skills of Radically Open Dialectical Behavior Therapy, Presented by Praxis
Radically Open Dialectical Behavior Therapy (RO DBT) is a treatment for patients who suffer from emotional and behavioral over-control. Some clients lack emotional control and need interventions designed to enhance emotional and behavioral control; others, for whom RO DBT is designed, require interventions designed to relax rigid or inflexible control. RO DBT has been researched over the past 20 years for patients with chronic depression or anorexia nervosa. Research results suggest that it is effective in these, and other, hard-to-treat groups such as Autism Spectrum Disorders and Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder.

### Course objectives:
1. Explain a new biosocial theory for OC
2. Describe a novel treatment mechanism positing open expression = trust = social connectedness
3. Describe new RO-DBT treatment strategies designed to enhance willingness for self-inquiry and flexible responding
4. Describe the four core deficits of Overcontrol
5. Describe the RO-DBT treatment structure
6. Describe the RO-DBT treatment hierarchy
7. Explain the most common indirect social signalling styles in OC
