### May 9th, 2017, Columbus, OH, USA
#### Organised by the College of Social Work, Ohio State University

#### Target Audience: Social Workers, Counsellors, MFTS, Psychiatrists and Psychologists
Radically-Open Dialectical Behavior Therapy (RO-DBT) is an evidence–based, transdiagnostic treatment that is now practiced in the UK, Europe, and North America. It is increasingly recognized as effective for patients who exhibit emotional or behavioral over-control by observing three core components of emotional well-being: openness, flexibility and connectedness.

This introductory workshop for social workers, counselors, therapists, psychiatrists and psychologists will provide clinicians with the theoretical foundations underlying RO-DBT, as well as a few key skills to engage with clients. By the end of this training, participants will be able to:

* Define biosocial theory for over-controlled disorders
* Identify RO-DBT treatment strategies designed to enhance flexible responding and social connection.
* Summarize the four core deficits of over-controlled disorders
* Describe various ways to assess for over-control and client appropriateness
