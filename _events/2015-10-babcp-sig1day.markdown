##About the workshop
Self-control, the ability to inhibit competing urges, impulses, or behaviours is highly valued by most societies. However, excessive self-control has been linked to social isolation, aloof interpersonal functioning, maladaptive perfectionism, constricted emotional expressions, and difficult-to-treat mental health problems, such as anorexia nervosa, obsessive compulsive personality disorder and refractory depression. The aim of this workshop is to introduce clinicians to the theoretical foundations and new skills underlying Radically Open-Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (RO-DBT) for disorders of overcontrol.<p>
The biosocial theory for overcontrol posits that heightened threat sensitivity and diminished reward sensitivity transact with early family experiences emphasizing “mistakes as intolerable” and “self-control as imperative” to result in an overcontrolled coping style that limits opportunities to learn new skills and exploit positive social reinforcers. A novel thesis linking the communicative functions of emotional expression to the formation of close social bonds will be introduced, as well as new skills emphasizing receptivity, self-enquiry and flexible responding. New approaches designed to activate a neurobiological-based social-safety system, signal cooperation, encourage genuine self-disclosure, practice loving-kindness, and change unhelpful envy/bitterness will be introduced using slides, handouts, video clips, and role-plays. 
Training Objectives. <p>
Upon completion of this one-day training, participants will be able to: <p>
1.	Explain a new biosocial theory for OC <p>
2.	Describe the RO-DBT treatment structure <p>
3.	Describe new RO-DBT treatment strategies designed to enhance willingness for self-inquiry and flexible responding.<p>
4.	Describe the RO-DBT treatment hierarchy<p>
5.	Describe a novel treatment mechanism positing open expression = trust = social connectedness <p>
6.	List examples of strategies designed to improve pro-social cooperative signalling via activation of the parasympathetic nervous system’s social-safety system<p>
