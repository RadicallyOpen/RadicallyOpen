#### August 11st, 2017, Chicago IL 

### Presented by: Michael Maslar, Psy.D.

Director of the Mindfulness and Behavior Therapies program at the Family Institute of Northwestern University
Radically Open Dialectical Behavior Therapy (RO DBT) is a treatment for patients who suffer from emotional and behavioral over-control. Some clients lack emotional control and need interventions designed to enhance emotional and behavioral control; others, for whom RO DBT is designed, require interventions designed to relax rigid or inflexible control. RO DBT has been researched over the past 20 years for patients with chronic depression or anorexia nervosa. Research results suggest that it is effective in these, and other, hard-to-treat groups such as Autism Spectrum Disorders and Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder.

### About the Training
Mindful Path is thrilled to host local RO-DBT expert, Michael Maslar Psy.D. from the Family Institute at Northwestern University. In this one day workshop, you will learn powerful techniques that can enhance your clinical skills with clients who may be overly controlled, perfectionistic, have treatment resistant anxiety and depression, anorexia nervosa, inhibited expression, and who may be risk avoidant, exhibit distress over-tolerance, and covert expression of hostility.

Dr. Maslar is a Licensed Clinical Psychologist, clinical supervisor, and clinical trainer, who is Director of the Mindfulness and Behavior Therapies program at the Family Institute of Northwestern University.
